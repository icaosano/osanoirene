Semantic HTML Form Project

🎯 Description  
This project is a semantic HTML implementation of a structured form based on a provided PDF specification. It demonstrates understanding of semantic HTML5 elements, form structure, and accessibility best practices—without the use of CSS styling.

☑️ Purpose of the Form  
The form is intended to collect detailed data from users.Its sections include:

- Personal Information
- Contact and Address Information
- Preferences and Interests
- Confirmation
- Additional Information


🗂 File Structure  
```
semantic-html-form/
├── index.html     // Main HTML file containing the form
└── README.md      // Project documentation
```

📌 Implementation Approach  
- *Semantic Tags Used*: `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<section>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`  
- *Accessibility*: Used proper `label` associations, logical input order, and fieldsets for grouped questions  
- *Form Structure*: Followed a top-down layout from basic personal info to confirmation and signature-
- *Validation*: Included HTML5 input types like `email`, `tel`, `date`, and `required` attributes for basic validation  
- *No CSS*: Focused entirely on semantic and functional structure without visual styling




📚 How to Use  
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser  
2. Fill in the form fields  
3. Review structure and accessibility features  
4. Use this as a reference for semantic HTML form developmen
